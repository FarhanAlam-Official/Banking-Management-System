   <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Banking Management System</strong> is designed to handle various banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, and fund transfers. The project implements fundamental banking features and aims to provide a secure environment for transactions by incorporating an OTP system for validating certain operations.</p>

   <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: Allows users to securely log in and access their banking information.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Creation & Management</strong>: Users can create new accounts and manage personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>OTP System</strong>: A demo implementation of One-Time Password (OTP) for secure transaction verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance Inquiry</strong>: Users can view their current account balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Money Transfer</strong>: Enables fund transfers between accounts, with appropriate validation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The system simulates a basic user interface to allow for secure and efficient management of banking tasks.</p>

   <h2 id="installation-instructions">Installation Instructions</h2>

 <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.</li>
        <li>Basic terminal or command-line interface knowledge to execute commands.</li>
    </ul>

 <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clone the repository</strong>: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/FarhanAlam-Official/banking-management-system.git</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Navigate to the project directory:
            <pre><code>cd banking-management-system</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Compile the program</strong>: Use GCC or any other C compiler to compile the source code:
            <pre><code>gcc -o banking_system banking_system.c</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Run the program</strong>: After successful compilation, execute the program:
            <pre><code>./banking_system</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

   <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>Once the program is running, users can interact with it through the command-line interface (CLI). The main options are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Login</strong>: Enter username and password to authenticate.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Account</strong>: Set up a new account with personal details and an initial balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance Inquiry</strong>: Check the current balance in your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Money Transfer</strong>: Transfer funds to other users or accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For secure transactions, the OTP system will be triggered during specific operations. Follow the prompts to verify the OTP for added security.</p>
