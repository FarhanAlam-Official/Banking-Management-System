## Project Overview

The **Banking Management System** is designed to handle various banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, and fund transfers. The project implements fundamental banking features and aims to provide a secure environment for transactions by incorporating an OTP system for validating certain operations.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to securely log in and access their banking information.
- **Account Creation & Management**: Users can create new accounts and manage personal information.
- **OTP System**: A demo implementation of One-Time Password (OTP) for secure transaction verification.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can view their current account balance.
- **Money Transfer**: Enables fund transfers between accounts, with appropriate validation.

The system simulates a basic user interface to allow for secure and efficient management of banking tasks.

## Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure login mechanism with password protection.
   - Option for users to manage their personal details and change login credentials.

### 2. **Account Management**
   - Users can create, view, and manage accounts with real-time updates to balance.

### 3. **OTP System (Demo)**
   - Demo One-Time Password (OTP) generation to add a layer of security during transactions.
   - OTPs are required for specific sensitive operations, ensuring secure interactions.

### 4. **Balance Inquiry**
   - Real-time display of account balances, allowing users to monitor their finances accurately.

### 5. **Money Transfer**
   - Users can transfer funds between their own accounts or to other accounts, with proper validation and confirmation.
   - Ensures smooth and secure transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Development Environment**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling C code
- **Operating Systems**: Cross-platform (Linux/Windows) compatible via terminal or command-line interface
- **Security**: Demonstrates basic OTP system for transaction verification

## Installation Instructions

To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
- Basic terminal or command-line interface knowledge to execute commands.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FarhanAlam-Official/banking-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
